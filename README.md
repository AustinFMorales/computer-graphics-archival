Showcase of projects I did in Computer Graphics

MP1 - sample project to get antiquated with the Unity toolkit itself. Simple program that spawns and generates objects that have predefined behavior

MP2 - A project focused on MVC. Here, we try to make a simple modeling editor in Unity while retaining the design philosophy of MVC

MP3 - This project is trying to apply the concepts of vector math before we delved deeper into computer graphics. In here I defined travelling spheres
that would spawn from the start of the line to end the line segment. If it hit a barrier with the normal facing it, it would calculate the reflection equation and bounce off of it.

Other functionality this program is the removal of line segments, rotation of the barrier, changing the endpoint position of line segments, and changing the travelling sphere attributes.

MP4 - Re-implement the functionality of parent-child relationships in 3D programs by scratch instead of Unity. Also had to create our own shader with texture support and recalculate it ourselves to display on the screen. The camera manipulation behavior of Unity is also recreated here as well. 
In this program, you're allowed to manipulate the joints of a humanoid made on screen. Because the hierarchy system is set in place, the transform of
each joint in the humanoid figure is represented accurately.

MP5 - Group project that allowed us to manipulate individual vertices and texture offsets. I was responsible for implementing the texture offseting calculated by the CPU and the shader itself to have texture support.
I also reimplemented the camera behavior from the previous project.
